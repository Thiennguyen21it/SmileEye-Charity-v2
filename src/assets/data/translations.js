    project_content:
      "How do you feel when you see the children in the above picture? I have met them in their village and in their school. These are children of the Ko-tu ethnic minority. I also experienced my childhood like that. We had no food and no clothes. And I was so happy that many people helped me and gave their love to me. They gave me food and clothes. They taught me many skills for survival and living with their kind heart. They helped me to develop my mind and my heart. I grew up in difficult conditions but I felt that people are always full of love and support. Thanks to that, I have developed my self so that I could received wonderful opportunities in my life. I got scholarship and successfully completed many practical education programs in Japan, including information technology, and NLP. I become confident. I love this life. My soul is now fully filled with love for people.<br><br>The more I look at the children, the more I feel choked up and I burst into tears. These Ko-tu children and the honest people here inspired me to my dream of volunteer. I will organize specific and practical charity projects and programs to support people in difficult areas. The immediate goal is to help them to have enough food. The next goal is to support them improve their skills. The goals will be achieved in a sustainable way.<br><br>If you have the same feelings as me, and have the same dreams as me, please join these charity projects with me. Our sincere participation will bring a lot of happiness to all parties. Our loves will help society develop and spread love.",

      "Each family has a land space of about 500m2. It is almost vacant currently. People grow some crops and raise some livestock according to old habits. They do not have access to science and technology for effective production. Most of them speak Co-tu language. All people in the village wish they can access farming techniques to develop their garden land for food.<br><br>This project aims to accompany and share sustainable organic vegetables and livestock farming techniques with the villagers. Project experts will work with people to build small-scale farming and livestock models in the village. They will come to the village, work together and share directly with the villagers how to farm, so that the villagers can deeply understand and practice directly. Since then, the villagers can master the techniques and can build their own garden for their family food.",

Currently, household waste and livestock waste have not been used to make fertilizer. These components are released into the environment, causing pollution. The villagers not only want to know how to make organic fertilizer for plants, but also want to make the villages environment cleaner and more beautiful.<br><br>The project aims to support the villagers to build a house to produce organic fertilizer from livestock waste, agricultural waste, and household waste. Experts will work with the villagers to share the mehtods of classifying, processing and producing organic fertilizer for their gardens. The environment will also be greener, cleaner and more beautiful.",

      "I was born and raised in a rural area of Quang Nam province. My childhood was filled with experiences with nature and love. My children and I played all kinds of games, including hide and seek, shooting arrows, shooting marbles, playing the leaf trumpet, playing checkers, jumping rope, catching fish and catching crabs, climbing trees to pick fruit, going into caves to catch bats, etc. My father is a teacher but he is also a very good farmer. Outside of work, he does all sorts of things. Land for growing rice, raising livestock, making wine, making vermicelli, making noodles, cutting hair, repairing cars, building houses, etc. My mother is also a teacher, and she also does all sorts of things after hours. She does herbal medicine, tutors, sells, etc. My parents always support each other when working. I followed my father and mother in most of my grandparents' jobs, so I experienced and learned many interesting things.<br><br>I went to college, worked, then studied abroad and working in Japan from 2026 to 2020. I have participated in many practical activities in Japan, from growing rice, growing potatoes, growing vegetables, cooking, baking meat, outdoor camping, fire prevention drills, etc. working as an IT project manager, doing a doctorate, working as a lecturer at Ritsumeikan University. Friends are both highly skilled in the field they love, have very sharp problem-solving skills, and are full of love. The love of relatives and friends helps me develop intellectually, heal wounds, and grow through real-life experiences. I was healed, became confident, optimistic, loved life, loved people, loved this life very much.<br><br>I realized that every time I participate in something to help others, I not only grow intellectually but am also healed. The love within me grows stronger. I love people more and love this life. This is truly a miracle. The more we help others, the more wisdom we develop and the happier we are. Join the project to experience these wonders with us.",
